 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>1. The Wedding Singer</h3>
 <p>Because Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make the best on screen couple and the soundtrack is awesome!</p>
 <h3>2. Pitch Perfect</h3>
 <p>Fat Amy is hilarious, I love the music and it brings me happy memories!</p>
 <h3>3. Happy Gilmore</h3>
 <p>Back for more Adam Sandler! It's a classic.</p>
